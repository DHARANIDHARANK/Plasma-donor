# Plasma-donor Application
Its a plasma donor application, in times crisis people who are in need of plasma we can get the donor details easily through this application and also person who are all willing to donate the blood all of us can register through this platform.

 **ABSTRACT**
The study of people's motivations and barriers to donating has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the entire blood donation habit. Even though whole blood donation has been thoroughly researched over the past 60 years, we still know relatively little about plasma donation in unpaid, voluntary settings.However, there has been a steady rise in the demand for plasmaderived products over the past few years, and blood collection organisations must change to satisfy this demand.This article seeks to cover the main factors that encourage and discourage whole blood donation and contrast them with those that we already understand about plasma donation.The evidence at hand reveals parallels between these activities, but also distinctions that point to the need for additional study.

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
Plasma protein treatments (PPTs) are used to treat a range of illnesses. Numerous of these are fatal, chronic, unusual, and frequently hereditary illnesses.PPTs, which are derived from human plasma, replace any missing or insufficient proteins. For the length of their lives, patients typically need to receive these treatments as frequent infusions or injections.PPTs are regarded as sole-source biologic goods since there are no generic or chemical alternatives.
